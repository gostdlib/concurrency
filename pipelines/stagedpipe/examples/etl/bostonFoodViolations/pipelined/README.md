# ETL Example Pipeline

This is a re-write of the ETL example by Ardan Labs that you can find at `../original` which uses the stagedpipe framework.

You can read the original article at:

You can read the article that goes with the code here:

To use these, you must download the food violations file and rename it to `violations.csv` in the root `bostonFoodViolations/` directory.
